# Example Usage with User Input:
# Prompt the user to input a list of numbers separated by spaces
input_numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")

# Convert the input string into a list of integers
numbers_list = [int(num) for num in input_numbers.split()]

# Prompt the user to input the number of rows and columns for the matrix
num_rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows for the matrix: "))
num_cols = int(input("Enter the number of columns for the matrix: "))

# Call the function to organize the list of numbers into a matrix
result_matrix = organize_into_matrix(numbers_list, num_rows, num_cols)

# Display the resulting matrix
print("Matrix Organized from the List:")
for row in result_matrix:
